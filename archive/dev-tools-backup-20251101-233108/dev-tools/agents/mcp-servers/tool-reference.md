> Default workspace root: `${ALLOWED_PATH:-/workspaces/ProspectPro}`. Knowledge graph snapshots and sequential thought logs are now managed exclusively by the Utility MCP. Legacy memory and sequentialthinking MCPs have been removed. All cognitive and knowledge graph operations should use the Utility MCP endpoints.

## Usage Notes

- The table is intended as a quick lookup; refer to each server's README or source for implementation details.
- Parameters marked with "—" indicate no arguments are required.
- Keep this file synchronized whenever the MCP registry changes or new tools are added.
