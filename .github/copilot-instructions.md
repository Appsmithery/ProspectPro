# ProspectPro Production Operations Guide

## Architecture Snapshot

- **Version**: 4.3.0 baseline with background discovery, enrichment, and export delivered by Supabase Edge Functions.
- **Frontend**: React/Vite app under `app/frontend/`; deploy with `npm run build` and Vercel production push.
- **Backend**: Supabase-first stack; Edge Functions live in `app/backend/functions/` (symlinked at root as `supabase/`) with schema tracked in `app/backend/schema/`.
- **Data Layer**: Supabase Postgres enforcing Row Level Security, campaign ownership, and authenticated exports.
- **Observability Toolchain**: MCP log forwarder, Supabase logs, and consolidated telemetry artifacts under `dev-tools-package/reports/`.
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth for anonymous + authenticated sessions via shared helpers.

## Target Repo Structure & Tool Suite

- **Domain separation**
  - `app/` – production UI, backend functions, shared client utilities, and embedded Vite config.
  - `dev-tools/` – retained for legacy compatibility during migration (being phased out).
  - `integration/` – partner connectors, infrastructure definitions, environment specs, and symlink management.
- **Reports & Telemetry**: Long-lived diagnostics, monitoring outputs, and observability configs stay in `dev-tools-package/reports/`. Legacy `Reports/` folders are being merged here; do not recreate root-level `reports/`.
- **Temporary & Working Files**: Use `dev-tools-package/workspace/context/session_store/` exclusively for scratch plans, coverage snapshots, logs-in-transit, and migration trackers. Clean up after shipping to keep it lightweight.
- **Automation & Tasks**: Prefer the curated VS Code tasks (see `.vscode/TASKS_REFERENCE.md`) and npm scripts in `package.json` for deployment, validation, and diagnostics before adding new workflows.

## Agent Profiles & Testing Suite

- **Portable agent profiles**: Canonical agents (`_development-workflow`, `_observability`, `_production-ops`, `_system-architect`, etc.) ship with coordinated `taskfile.yaml`, `toolset.jsonc`, `instructions.md`, and `config.json` assets. Treat the set as a portable package you can drop into other repos without app-specific rewrites.
- **Automation lives in Taskfiles**: Each agent’s `taskfile.yaml` is the primary home for lint, unit, integration, and cross-browser E2E orchestration. `.vscode/tasks.json` exposes only thin shims so VS Code’s Run/Debug UI mirrors the Task CLI experience without duplicating logic.
- **Unified tooling**: Tasks invoke Vitest, Playwright, and Deno pipelines, refresh documentation/inventories, and sync telemetry (Highlight/OpenTelemetry) through the agent’s defined MCP toolset. The suite should always be runnable via `task` or the VS Code Testing panel with no manual wiring.
- **Workspace flow**: Developers install dependencies once, pick the agent profile that matches their role, and trigger the curated tasks. Automation cascades across app + dev-tools boundaries, captures artifacts under `dev-tools-package/reports/`, and writes provenance to session_store inventories so migrations stay auditable.
- **Separation of concerns**: Integration between `dev-tools` and `app` stays intentionally light—agents remain app-agnostic modules that validate the full stack yet remain portable for future projects.

## Data Integrity & Integrations

- Production data only—no synthetic pipelines.
- Core integrations: Google Place Details (authority data), Hunter.io + NeverBounce (email discovery/deliverability), Cobalt Intelligence + licensing directories (executive verification), chamber/trade association feeds (membership), Foursquare Places (category enrichment).
- Record anomalies and verification notes in `dev-tools-package/workspace/context/session_store/coverage.md` or linked playbooks before release.

## Tooling & Automation Guardrails

- **Chat modes**: `Development Workflow`, `Observability`, `Production Ops`, `System Architect` found under `.github/chatmodes/`.
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Author in `docs/{app,dev-tools,integration}/diagrams/`; validate via `npm run docs:prepare` before publishing.
- **MCP Servers**: `dev-tools-package/agents/mcp-servers/` hosts the sources; configuration is centralized in `.vscode/mcp_config.json` (referenced via `.vscode/settings.json`), and changes must be logged in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md`. Rebuild the Utility MCP with `npm run build --prefix dev-tools-package/agents/mcp-servers/utility` after config updates. Start troubleshooting with `npm run mcp:troubleshoot` (root) or `npm run start:troubleshooting` (from `dev-tools-package/agents/mcp-servers/`).
- **Supabase CLI**: Run from `/workspaces/ProspectPro/supabase` (symlinked to `app/backend/`) via `npx --yes supabase@latest`; keep auth fresh with `dev-tools-package/scripts/operations/ensure-supabase-cli-session.sh`.
- **Automation scripts**: `dev-tools-package/scripts/automation/` and `dev-tools-package/automation/ci-cd/` handle log pulls, Vercel checks, and context snapshots; outputs captured in `dev-tools-package/reports/` once finalized.

## Workspace & Editor Settings

- **Playwright E2E Testing**: All major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and required Linux dependencies are installed. Playwright config enables full cross-browser testing. Use `npx playwright test` or VS Code test explorer.
- **Deno for Edge Functions**: Deno is enabled for all backend Edge Functions in `app/backend/functions/`. Linting and unstable features are supported via workspace settings.
- **Prettier & ESLint**: Prettier is the default formatter (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`), with format-on-save and explicit code actions on save. ESLint is enforced for all TypeScript/React code.
- **File/Folder Exclusions & Associations**: `.vscode/settings.json` excludes heavy folders (node_modules, dist, logs, archive) and associates file types for SQL, Mermaid, Markdown, and dotenv. File nesting is enabled for clarity in the explorer.
- **MCP Servers & Automation**: MCP servers and automation flows are managed via curated VS Code tasks and npm scripts. See `.vscode/tasks.json` and workspace tasks for build, deploy, and diagnostics.
- **Staging Editor Config Changes**: All changes to `.vscode/` or `.github/` configs must be staged in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md` before merging to main. This ensures reproducibility and auditability of automation and validation flows.

## Deployment & Validation

1. **Frontend**: `npm run build`, then deploy `dist/` with `npx --yes vercel@latest --prod --confirm --scope appsmithery --project prospect-pro --cwd dist` or the `Deploy: Full Automated Frontend` task.
2. **Edge Functions**: `npx --yes supabase@latest functions deploy <slug> --no-verify-jwt` from `/workspaces/ProspectPro/supabase` (or `app/backend/`); batch options available via `npm run deploy:<group>`.
3. **Quality Gates**: `npm run docs:prepare`, `npm run docs:update`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run supabase:test:db` (pgTAP) prior to release.
4. **Post-deploy smoke**: Supabase curl probes (`docs/edge-auth-testing.md`), Vercel health checks, and MCP diagnostics tasks.

## Workspace Practices

- Stage `.vscode/` and `.github/` proposals in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md` before editing live configs.
- Follow relocation sequencing in `dev-tools-package/workspace/context/session_store/REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md` (canonical migration roadmap).
- Update inventories in `dev-tools-package/workspace/context/session_store/{app-filetree,dev-tools-filetree,integration-filetree}.txt` whenever files move; log provenance in `coverage.md`.
- After migratory work, run `npm run docs:update` and refresh references in FAST README and platform playbooks.

### Environment & Secrets Management (Canonical Workflow)

- **Primary agent env file:** `dev-tools-package/agents/.env.agent.local` is the single source of truth for agent secrets and environment variables in local dev and CI. It is gitignored and must never be committed with real secrets. Hydrate it using:
  - `dev-tools-package/agents/scripts/hydrate-local-env.sh` (pulls from Vercel/Supabase, requires `VERCEL_TOKEN` and optionally `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`)
  - Or manually add/override variables for local testing (never commit real secrets)
- **Templates:** `.env.example` provides a reference for required keys and structure.
- **Frontend/Edge/Other:** Frontend uses `.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc., hydrated via Vercel CLI or `npm run env:pull`. Edge functions and MCP servers read from `.env.agent.local` or injected secrets in CI/CD.
- **Validation:** Run `dev-tools-package/agents/scripts/validate-agents.sh` to check all required secrets for each agent persona. Run `npm run validate:ignores` to ensure no secrets or sensitive files are accidentally committed.
- **Production/staging secrets:** Managed via Vercel and Supabase dashboards; never stored in the repo. Staging/production inherit Highlight and other credentials from Vercel environment groups.
- **Troubleshooting:** If validation fails, ensure `.env.agent.local` exists and is hydrated. For new secrets, update `.env.example` and the hydration script as needed.

**Deno/Supabase Edge Test Hydration:**
For Deno-based Supabase Edge tests (see `app/tests/deno`), you must provide `SUPABASE_SESSION_JWT` in your `.env.local` (or export it manually) before running tests. See `dev-tools-package/scripts/testing/README-deno-env.md` for details and the export script. This is not hydrated by Vercel by default.

## Copilot Response Guidelines

1. Assume the team understands the production architecture; focus on actionable fixes.
2. Cite concrete paths or existing scripts instead of inventing new workflows.
3. Recommend established tasks or npm scripts before bespoke commands.
4. Flag any configuration change proposals in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md`.
5. Reference the relocation roadmap and REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md when advising on structural work.
6. Align suggestions with current production behavior, Supabase-first design, and latest automation wiring.
7. Keep answers concise, oriented around debugging, deployment, automation, and data quality.
8. Use the session_store inventories to verify layout changes and capture updates in `coverage.md`.
9. After major repo structure or automation changes, suggest next steps for CI wiring, automation validation, and provenance logging.
