# Phase 5: Environment-Bound Validation Log

## 2025-10-27: Initiate Environment-Bound Agent Validation

- **Action**: Begin Phase 5 of the MECE agent/MCP integration plan: environment-bound validation for all agents.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Build MCP tools: `npm run build:tools --prefix dev-tools/agents/mcp-servers`
  - [ ] Hydrate `dev-tools/agents/.env.agent.local` from provider secret stores (Vercel, Supabase, GitHub)
  - [ ] Test agent MCP access with required secrets for each environment using `dotenv -e dev-tools/agents/.env.agent.local -- <command>`
  - [ ] Smoke test memory and sequential MCPs
  - [ ] Log results to `coverage.md`
- **Reference**: See `mece-agent-mcp-integration-plan.md` for validation steps and commands.
